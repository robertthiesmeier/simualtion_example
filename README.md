**Simualtion of a simple prospective cohort study**

This is a simple code to illustarte the idea of simulating 
a prospective cohort study with an exposure, X, and a binary outcome, Y. 
To design and simulate the process of showing a distribution of the effect of the exposure X on the outcome probability of Y, we need four numbers: 
the sample size, the exposure prevalence, and the outcome probabilities among exposed and unexposed individuals. 

Let us set the number of participants to n=1,000 in our study. We know that the exposure prevalence is 20%. 
We also know that, among the unexposed, the proportion of people having developed the outcome is 10%, whereas such outcome 
proportion among the exposed is 30%. This gives us an odds ratio of about 3.9, meaning that the odds of having the outcome are 
3.9 higher for the exposed as opposed to the unexposed group.
