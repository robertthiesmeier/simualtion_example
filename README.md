# Simualtion of a simple prospective cohort study

This is a simple code to illustarte the idea of simulating a prospective cohort study with an exposure, X, and a binary outcome, Y. 
To design and simulate the process of showing a distribution of the effect of the exposure X on the outcome probability of Y, we need four numbers: 
the sample size, the exposure prevalence, and the outcome probabilities among exposed and unexposed individuals.
